Navigate To MySqlAPI Folder using CMD (where MySqlAPI.csproj is located).

run: "dotnet restore" to download MySQL extension packet.
run: "dotnet run" command in cmd.

This API requires at least dotnet v6.0 SDK. If this is not installed, it can be installed from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

WARNING! this repo does not contain the binary files, and thus atleast one "dotnet run" or "dotnet build" is required to build the binary/metadata files!

This project was made using VSCode, and thus does not contain the .sln file! This project can be imported to a MSVS solution however.

By default this project is set to connect my own MySQL server running on my rasperrypi at home.
This connecting might be a bit slow. It can also be accessed using a 3rd party client tool to get full access.
    
    INFO: This project uses MySQL instead of Microsoft SQL Server!

    MySQL credientials:
        ip adress: karppi2.asuscomm.com
        username: test
        password: test
        port: 3306
    
    From there you can find "testdatabase" as a default database which is set for this project for testing purposes!
